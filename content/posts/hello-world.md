I suppose this is a bit of a test and attempt to start writing more blogs again. I've had a blog for a while but it has to be manually deployed via cli tools which is slightly a pain. My hope is that this blog which can be edited online will inspire me to write more posts. I'll try and drop everything here from tool releases, quick tips for stuff I'm working, or maybe more long form thoughts on how computers were absolutely and completely a mistake.
